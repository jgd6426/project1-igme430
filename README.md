# Project 1 - IGME.430
Creating a rich web application that uses a backend web API of my design.

### What is the intended purpose of this application?
- Card-based task tracking system, based on Trello.
- A recipe-tracking app that allows users to write down recipes, search for and save new recipes (using an external API), and sort their recipes based on certain categories.

Possible Sorting Categories: 
- Want to make
- Have made it before
- Currently Making?
  
  --> Would enlarge the card and all the information?
  
  --> or figure out where to bring the user if they want to see only one recipe
- Favorites?
### What data will be stored and delivered by the API?
- Recipe Name & Author
- Prep/Cook-Time (optional)
- Ingredients & Measurements
- Cooking steps
- Picture? Either the user chooses their own picture (through URL?) or choose from select options?
- Other notes (optional)
- Star Rating? (optional) or one star to add to favorites?
### What work has been completed for the prototype?
-
### What work is left, and what is the plan to complete it?
- 
### Is there a plan for going above and beyond? If so, what is it?
- CSS framework --> I want it to look professional
### If the project uses any borrowed code or code fragments, where did they come from? What do the code fragments do? Where are they in the code?
