# Project 1 - IGME.430
Creating a rich web application that uses a backend web API of my design

### What is the intended purpose of this application?
- Card-based task tracking system, based on Trello.
- A recipe-tracking app that allows users to write down recipes, search for and save new recipes (using an external API), and sort their recipes based on certain categories.

  OR
  
- A fitness-tracking app that allows users to sort exercises into workout plans. Users can write their own exercises on new cards, or search for existing exercises.
### What data will be stored and delivered by the API?
Recipe Idea: 
- Recipe name, author,
- Prep/Cook-Time (optional)
- Ingredients & Measurements
- Cooking steps
- Picture? Either the user chooses their own picture (through URL?) or 
  
Fitness Idea:
- Exercise name
- Target muscle/area
- Time/number of reps
- Type (ex. strength, cardio, etc.)
- Equipment (optional)
- Difficulty (optional)
- Instructions/other notes
### What work has been completed for the prototype?
-
### What work is left, and what is the plan to complete it?
- 
### Is there a plan for going above and beyond? If so, what is it?
- CSS framework --> I want it to look professional
### If the project uses any borrowed code or code fragments, where did they come from? What do the code fragments do? Where are they in the code?
