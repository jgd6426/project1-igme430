# Project 1 - IGME.430
Creating a rich web application that uses a backend web API of my design

### What is the intended purpose of this application?
- Card-based task tracking system, based off of Trello.
- A recipe tracking app that allows users to write down recipes, search for and save new recipes (using an external API), and sort their recipes based on certin categories.
### What data will be stored and delivered by the API?
- Recipe name, author, prep-time (optional)
- Ingredients & their measurements
- Cooking steps
### What work has been completed for the prototype?

### What work is left, and what is the plan to complete it?

### Is there a plan for going above and beyond? If so, what is it?
- CSS framework --> I want it to look professional
### If the project uses any borrowed code or code fragments, where did they come from? What do the code fragments do? Where are they in the code?
