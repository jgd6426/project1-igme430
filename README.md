# Project 1 - IGME.430
Creating a rich web application that uses a backend web API of my design.

### What is the intended purpose of this application?
- Card-based task tracking system, based on Trello.
- A recipe-tracking app that allows users to write down recipes and sort them based on if they want to make them, have made them before, or a favorite.

### What data will be stored and delivered by the API?
- Recipe Name
- Ingredients (& Measurements)
- Cooking directions

### What went right in the development of this project?
- The status codes work, the user is able to add new recipes, and are able to update existing recipes by putting the same name in the place to write a new one.
- Can drag and drop recipe cards between categories
- Recipe cards expand and collapse when clicked on

### What went wrong in the development of this project?
- The added recipes don't show up as cards on the screen.
- There was also supposed to be a background image as part of the styling but that isn't showing up

### What did I learn while developing this project?
- I don't fully understand how everything works and is connected. I know enough to find what I need and get it mostly working, but I'm not confident that I could explain what is happening to someone else.

### If I were to continue, what would I do to improve the application?
- Get the newly created recipe cards to actually show up on screen
- Fix the background image styling issue
- Maybe incorporate the use of an external api to allow the user to also search for other exsting recipes

### How did I go above and beyond?
- More than basic CSS

### If the project uses any borrowed code or code fragments, where did they come from? What do the code fragments do? Where are they in the code?
- Borrowed code from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_collapsible in client.html lines 115-128, and from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp also in client.html lines 99-111
